This program is released up the GPL v2.

8.18.11

The program compiles fine but as of 8.18.11, it seg faults after letting you pick your ships.  This was orginally written in BSD for windows and now I am compiling it in Linux so who knows where the error is.  Moost likely a single char error.  I will get to it as time allows.
